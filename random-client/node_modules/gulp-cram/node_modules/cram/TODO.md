Next steps

* single-file operation when runjs is not a module
	- unbundled / dev:
		- the plain js file must be loaded without the js! plugin
			- this can fixed in curl.js by auto-defining when def.id ends with ".js"
	- bundled:
		- if the original code is placed after the loader, it executes fine
		- however, the loader will find data-curl-run on the script el and
		  try to load the file again
		  	- this is a cram.js issue: we have to auto-define in cram, too.

* auto-define .js files
	- auto-define when:
		- id ends with ".js" and no define() was encountered
	- fail when:
		- define() is found in file and id ends with ".js"


* cujo quickstart templates



multiple bundles:

* concept of a "final" bundle?
	- external paths/urls are hard-coded
		- where? in the module ids or in a run.js/config?
	- transforms are pre-performed
		- seems like we should do this all the time?
	- plugins output AMD modules w/ (ideally) no plugins


data-curl-run vs data-curl-main

main is a module
run is a script

how to detect if run.js loaded correctly?
